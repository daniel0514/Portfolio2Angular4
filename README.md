## Description
This dynamic portfolio website was initially built with HTML/CSS/JavaScript and jQuery ([code](https://github.com/daniel0514/Portfolio2)). For the backend component, 
I created a RESTful API to handle GET/POST/DELETE requests with Node.js to access the data stored in a MongoDB 
database in JSON ([code](https://github.com/daniel0514/Portfolio2MEANvers)). The website was later rebuilt with Angular1 framework. To learn the latest AngularJS framework, 
the website was upgraded to Angular4 and TypeScript.

## To run this website

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
